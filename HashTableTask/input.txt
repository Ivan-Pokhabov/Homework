There haven’t been any new children for a long time now. Melanie doesn’t
know why that is. There used to be lots; every week, or every couple of
weeks, voices in the night. Muttered orders, complaints, the occasional curse.
A cell door slamming. Then, after a while, usually a month or two, a new face
in the classroom – a new boy or girl who hadn’t even learned to talk yet. But
they got it fast.
